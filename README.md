My Personal Site (old)
===================

For a long time I used Yii for myself and at work, I started with version 1.
But the speed of development of Yii leaves much to be desired.
New approaches to development have emerged and itâ€™s time to try them out.
I will save this site as a keepsake.

**Used:** [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) :broken_heart:
